                    "This evening I experimented with running dMagnetic is it's sixel mode. Sixel was an early bitmap graphics format that was used on DEC VT terminals. So far I have only managed to get the required VT340 mode working through xterm using the command <code>xterm -ti vt340</code>. The sixel graphics look pretty good but unfortunately kitty, the terminal emulator I usually use, does not support it. I attach the previous scene from Jinxster rendered in sixel mode.",
                    "Back to the game, Jinxster is interesting from what I have played so far. It seems to incorporate elements of magical realism, a good parser and a wry sense of humour. I am hoping to get the opportunity this week to spend some more time with it."

                    "I had fun yesterday playing Plundered Hearts on a train journey across the UK, it's a riveting story ! It was also good to get experience with using IFMapper. This morning I watched an interesting YouTube video by Kim Justice on the interactive fiction games created by the Magnetic Scrolls studio. These games were text based but also incorporated beautiful artwork. I was interested on how to play their games on Linux and found an interpreter called dMagnetic (https://dettus.net/dMagnetic/). I could find no Arch Linux packages available but I was able to download the source package from the website and compile it without any issues. I am running dMagnetic from the terminal in its utf video mode <code>dMagnetic -mag jinxter.mag -gfx jinxter.gfx -vmode utf</code>, which provides a good render for a terminal application. There is also a GTK version available, which I may try at a later date.",

      "I have been playing the Infocom adventure Enchanter with Frotz over the last fortnight. I wanted a basic terminal based mapping tool where I could keep track of the rooms I had visited. Rather than a grid based map I thought to choose the terminal based mind mapping tool h-m-m (https://github.com/nadrad/h-m-m). This is a simple tool that allows you to create nodes and connect them together. I found it easy to use and it worked well for my needs. I created a node for each room and connected them together as I explored the game. I also added notes to each node to help me remember important details. One feature of h-m-m is the ability to export the graph as an html file ( /files/enchanter_map.html).",
      "Today I made the decision to move over to using the IFMapper tool (https://ggarra13.github.io/ifmapper/en/start.html). This is a more specialised tool for mapping interactive fiction games. The main reason to migrate was that although h-m-m worked well on Arch Linux, I found it difficult to install on other distros. Having reached Expert Enchanter rank on Enchanter I have decided to start a new text adventure and map, this time choosing Plundered Hearts."

                    "I picked up an RP2350 Pico 2 microcontroller from the Raspberry Pi store in Cambridge last weekend with a plan to combine it with an HDMI display and mechanical keyboard I had spare. I mounted the RP2350 in an Olimex rp2040-pico-pc motherboard and flashed the Pico 2 with the Picomite BASIC core (https://geoffg.net - the PicoMiteHDMIUSB core). Although this core is compatible with the rp2040-pico-pc board I did have to blind set the HDMI support option using the keyboard via the <code>option reset olimexusb</code> command. This set the necessary options to connect to the display via the Olimex HDMI port, after which I reset the Olimex board.",

As the deck was running similar BASIC firmware to the Clockwork Pi PicoCalc handheld device, I was able to use the software written for this platform."

The Barbican is a brutalist residential complex in the centre of London, containing shops, gardens, restaurants, theatres and gallery spaces. I worked nearby during the several years I lived in London and would spend my lunch breaks either in the garden, restaurant or basement. Shown here, the strikingly orange painted basement always provided a quiet, calm space from the busy city. I would sit here coding my own projects or playing Discworld MUD.",

On Fridays, I would treat myself to a roast duck dinner in the restaurant and sometimes a book from it's bookshop. I never returned after the Pandemic, maybe it had changed as I had. I would soon leave London and start a new chapter of my life."
