				<h2>miniCPM - 13 March 2024</h2>
				<img src="/assets/miniCPM-manual.png" style="width: 20vw; min-width: 140px;">
				<p> As a child in the late seventies/ early eighties I was obsessed with computers. This obsession began with a trip to the computer lab at the University of East Anglia and my father kindly buying me a TI-99/4A microcomputer. Around this time BBC microcomputers were purchased by my high school, replacing their CP/M based Research Machines 380Z microcomputer. I remember giving up my lunch breaks with a friend to port the school's 380Z Basic programs over to BBC Basic. Sadly I never got to use that 380Z again but was re-united with one at the Cambridge Computer and Video Game museum last year.</p>

				<p> For twenty years I worked as a backend software engineer, mostly on linux systems, and I am interested in the history of computing. During the pandemic I passed the time by watching reruns of the US PBS show Computer Chronicles on Twitch and became interested in CP/M (the show's co-host was Gary Kildall, the creator of CP/M). I had the idea to create a desktop machine with which I could experiment with CP/M and I was looking forward to playing some Infocom adventures on it, as I learnt these were available for CP/M 2.2. As I am not working I was reluctant to purchase one of the Z80 kits, which are popular these days, or buy an authentic machine, due to cost. Fortunately I was given an Amazon voucher as a gift which bought me an Arduino Due microcontroller and with the wonderful Due compatible CP/M emulator <a href="https://github.com/MockbaTheBorg/RunCPM/">RunCPM</a> I was able to create a CP/M 2.2 machine that I could connect to over the Arduino serial port.</p>
				<p> I had become inspired by Raspberry Pi projects to emulate vintage computers popular when I was a child so I decided to bundle my Arduino CP/M machine with a Raspberry Pi Zero acting as a client interface, using minicom as the terminal emulator. There was a bare metal terminal project available for the Pi Zero but, at the time, it did not support the usb serial connection I was using for my prototype. As I only had a day for the build I settled for minicom running on Raspberry Pi OS Lite. I also added a small usb hub board, as the usb ports available on the Pi are limited and a soft shutdown button (driven by a python script).</p>

				<p> I needed a name for my machine so I have called it miniCPM.</p>
				<img src="/assets/miniCPM-front.png" style="width: 50vw; min-width: 140px;">
				<p> Now it is built I have a small CP/M box to play around with Z80 development (Aztec-C, Pascal, Lisp) and play adventure games on.</p>

				<p> I may come back to this project in the future to add other features such as a power led.</p>
